# ChessCLI

## Introduction

This is one of the first small projects I made during my career change training. With the self imposed rule to only use built-ins and no other dependencies.

It's a simple CLI Chess application with movable pieces but without the chess rules.

## Installation

Clone the repository into the desired location and have Python installed.

## Running the game

In the terminal move into the cloned directory and run

```sh
python main.py
```
